# Create simple, connected experiences with API-based integration

This repository is now archived as of Q1 '25

## Description
Build a unified catalog and a developer portal for all APIs, regardless of where they're managed. Create your own digital experiences with SAP Build Apps, SAP Integration Suite, and SAP Build Process Automation to operationalize access requests, federate API from disparate gateways, and monetize their use.

In an API-first economy, the new business opportunities created from transactional and analytical systems are invaluable. Ensure governance, agility, and a clean line of sight into consumption help you make the most of them.

## Challenge
While the consumption of APIs is a standard function of software development, API providers face several unique challenges. These include securing access to sensitive data in the cloud and on-premise systems, managing APIs across a heterogeneous landscape, and creating revenue opportunities from internal and external usage.

## Solution
A single point of access to all APIs for all developers, powered by workflows and event-based integration with non-SAP API management software. This unified catalog consists of a tailored UX, a developer onboarding process, and an automated billing process based on rate plans.

## Outcome
An empowered developer ecosystem with self-service access to API, supported by secure digital processes. Reference architectures for federation of remotely managed API, customized developer portal, and billing and invoicing of rate plans with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

## Requirements
You can find the detailed pre-requisites for running each part of this mission in the [Getting started guide](./01-GettingStartedGuide/README.md)

## Download and Installation
- Artifacts needed for the low-code developer portal scenario can be found in a [dedicated branch](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-create-api-integrations/tree/low-code-dev-portal)

## Known Issues
- API bills can only be read for completed months, not current month
